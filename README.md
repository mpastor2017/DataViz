# bigdatacourse

Clone your repository of the homework assignment to this central private repository. Name it as lastname_firstname (for example: doe_john).

For each homework assignment, create an empty git repository. Link it to git@github.com:MSIA/bigdatacourse.git

Work in your local repository (without pushing/cloning/branching to the github main repository; if you do, other students will be able to access your work). 

When you are done with the homework assignment (clerly before the due date), do the following:
1) Create a branch of your work in your local git repository
2) Push the branch to the github repository
